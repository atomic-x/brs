				    everywhere now. They are those mysterious square boxes with black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background.
				</p>
				<p>
				    The name stands for Quick Response Code, because that is exactly what they do. If you have a smart phone you can scan the QR code and gain immediate access
				    to a website, cell phone or e-mail address.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Businesses are using the QR code everywhere . . . on business cards, your business front door, print ads, real estate signs, t-shirts, invoices or any
				    promotional product. QR codes are becoming more popular. With today's technology your customers can access your information at their convenience, on their
				    own time!
				</p>
				<p>
				    In June 2011, 14 million mobile users in the US - that's about 6.2% of the total mobile audience in our country - scanned a QR or bar code on their mobile
				    device, according to a study by
				    <a href="http://www.internetretailing.net/2011/08/14m-americans-scanned-qr-and-bar-codes-with-their-mobiles-in-june-2011/">comScore</a>.  The study found
				    that the users are most likely to scan codes found in newspapers/magazines and on product packaging and do so while at home or in a store.

				<strong style="color: #006DB6;">Business Review</strong> believes that it is important to get the message out about the <strong style="color: #006DB6;">importance of supporting local businesses</strong>.  We believe that local businesses are the backbone of this country.  They are an essential element of, and a major contributor to the strength of local economies. First, we are not only talking about locally owned businesses, we are talking about local businesses; a business that is operated out of or serves a particular community. They employ our friends and neighbors, use the goods and services of other local businesses, serve as community hubs and are vital components of healthy neighborhoods.
			</p>
			<p>When consumers patronize local businesses, they are essentially giving money back to their local community. A thriving local business will generate high levels of revenue, which means that the business will pay higher taxes, including local taxes. This money is then used for local police and fire departments as well as some schools. In this ever-changing world, communities that preserve their one-of-a-kind businesses and distinctive character provide the building blocks for future growth, safety and beauty of the community in which you live! </p>
			<p>Our publications are all about local businesses.  Over the years, we may have changed the look and distribution of our publication but never the mission.  We will continue to help local businesses get their name out to the community through our mailed publication, the internet and social media as well as our digital version.  We will always keep up to date with the newest innovations in advertising. </p>
			<p>Our employees are also an integral part of our company.  Most of them have been with us for many years.  Through their commitment to <strong style="color: #006DB6;">Business Review</strong> and their customers, they will be here for you now and in the future.   <strong style="color: #006DB6;">Business Review</strong> is a proud company and feels fortunate to have had the opportunity to help educate thousands of local communities on the importance of their continued support of their local businesses.</p>

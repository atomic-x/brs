				    Reasons Small Business Owners Need A Website
				</h2>
				<p class="unwrapped">
				    <b style="font-size:24px;">M</b>aybe you think you don't need a website. You don't sell on-line or your business has been around forever without a website.
				    You may think you cannot afford it or you don't have time to get it up and running. However, having an on-line presence is vital to your business.
				</p>
				<ul class="unwrapped">
				    <li>
					A website reinforces your business legitimacy. It shows you have an investment in your business and provides customer confidence. It's as
					important as having a phone number. Not having one raises questions in your customers' eyes. 
				    </li>
				    <li>
					Your business operations are reliant on your office hours. Having an on-line presence makes you visible to customers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
				    </li>
				    <li>
					Many of your competitors have a website. A professional website levels the playing field by exposing your business to a much wider audience.
				    </li>
				    <li>
					Most people research a company on the internet before they call them.
				    </li>
				    <li>
					Americans are now spending as much time using the Internet as they are watching television, and the amount of time people spend on the Internet has
					increased 121 percent over the last five years (survey published by Forrester Research).
				    </li>

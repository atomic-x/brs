					Reasons and Facts to Support Local Businesses...
				</p>
				<p>
					Local businesses are an essential element of, and major contributor to the strength of local economies. First of all, we are not only talking about locally owned businesses, we are talking about local businesses, a business that is operated out of, or serves a particular community. They employ our friends and neighbors, use the goods and services of other local businesses, serve as community hubs, and are vital components of healthy neighborhoods. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When consumers patronize local businesses, they are essentially giving money back to their local community. A thriving local business will generate high levels of revenue, which means that the business will pay higher taxes, including local taxes. This money is then used for local police and fire departments as well as some schools. In this ever changing world, communities that preserve their one-of-a-kind businesses and distinctive character provide the building blocks to future growth, safety and beauty of the community in which you live!

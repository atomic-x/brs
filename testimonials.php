				<p class="copy">To: Julie Wood, Business Review Services,</p>
				
				<p class="copy">"I want to express my appreciation for the help you and Kim give me in preparation and follow through for the
				      ad in "A Close Up Look At Local Businesses". You make my job easy - - - I approve the ad after you prepare the
				      script and then you take the ball and run with it. Your office appears very organized and professional. I write
				      you the check and I can expect a paid receipt in short order. I receive a copy of the finished product and then
				      when items are mailed I receive extra copies. This is additional exposure for me as each advertiser will display
				      the ad in their waiting area for more readership. Thank you for a job well done!" <b>Ed Bitzer- State Farm
				      Agent</b>
